# REdiSim

REdiSim is a system which allows for Deep Distributed GPU-Accelerated Reinforcement Learning, created as part of my Honours Project at the School of Informatics at Edinburgh University. It is built primarily in this release for use with NVIDIA's Isaac Gym platform, along with rl-games for the reinforcement learning algorithms.
